    <p>
        I'm a math major turned self-taught coder who's passionate about bridging the gap between technology and business. I've been teaching others about the exciting world of crypto for years and love nothing more than sharing my knowledge. As a certified ethical hacker, I am a cybersecurity enthusiast who's dedicated to keeping networks and devices safe. With over 10 years of experience in small business and home network management, I am well-versed in Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

        <br><br>I’m also fluent in Spanish, a full-stack Python developer with over 50k app downloads on GooglePlay.

        In addition, I have over a decade of experience in legal cannabis retail management and software development/training. I am a master of agile project management and have lead projects involving the implementation of new features for websites, software and apps.

        When I'm not working, you can find me behind the camera as a cinematographer or on the mat as a practitioner of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I'm a technology lover, privacy advocate and a strong believer in the potential of merging technology and organic for a sustainable future.
